Using hybridauth with yii-user-management:

1.) Configure 'loginType' in UserModule configuration to include 'hybridauth' in your
application config/main.php

2.) Select the providers you want to use in the 'hybridAuthProviders' array.

3.) Take the modules/user/vendors/index.php, rename it to 'hybridauth.php' and place it 
beside your application index.php bootstrap script. 

4.) Configure and place your hybridauth configuration file. Set the base_url
to the hybridauth.php script configured above.

5.) Place the configuration file into your application
protected/config/hybridauth.php. This path can be configured with the
